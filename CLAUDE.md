# CLAUDE.md — agentic-scaffold

A Cowork plugin that scaffolds agentic best practices into any repo. One `/init` command generates 5 core files (README.md, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, DECISIONS.md, ROADMAP.md) plus adaptive files based on your tooling and team setup.

## Project Identity

- **Name:** agentic-scaffold
- **Type:** Claude Agent SDK plugin (Claude Code, Cowork, Cursor)
- **Version:** 0.4.1
- **Stack:** Markdown templates + SKILL.md workflow specification (no runtime dependencies)

## Key Conventions

### Templates
- Template files use `{{variable}}` interpolation (simple string replacement, no engine)
- All templates live in `templates/` and are referenced via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/`
- Every template includes a source attribution footer comment
- Template variables: `{{project_name}}`, `{{description}}`, `{{stack}}`, `{{directory_structure}}`, `{{stack_conventions}}`, `{{date}}`, `{{year}}`, `{{license}}`

### Skills

This plugin provides two skills:

- **init** — scaffolds the five core agentic files (including CHANGELOG.md) into a new repo
- **logchange** — maintains CHANGELOG.md over the project's lifetime

logchange lives here because it maintains CHANGELOG.md, which agentic-scaffold generates — same artifact lifecycle. scaffold creates the file, logchange keeps it current.

### SKILL.md
- Follows CSO (Claude Search Optimization) pattern: description triggers on conditions, doesn't summarize workflow
- YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields
- Workflow is fully self-contained — an agent should be able to execute it with no external context

### Distribution

This plugin supports two installation paths:

- **Claude Code CLI:** `claude plugins install github.com/montymerlin/agentic-scaffold` (uses `marketplace.json`)
- **Claude Cowork (desktop):** Package as `.plugin` zip and drag into Cowork chat, or install from the plugin marketplace

Both paths load the same skills from the same source. The plugin has no runtime dependencies and no host-specific code.

**Packaging for Cowork:** `zip -r agentic-scaffold.plugin . -x ".git/*" ".DS_Store"` from the plugin root directory.

**Auto-update:** Claude Code pins to a commit SHA at install time; users update manually or via marketplace sync. Cowork requires re-uploading the `.plugin` file or GitHub sync if configured at the organization level.

**Version alignment:** plugin.json version must match CHANGELOG.md latest entry and marketplace.json version.

### Documentation
- README.md is human-facing — explains what the plugin does, how to use it, design sources
- CLAUDE.md (this file) is agent-facing — conventions, structure, boundaries
- DECISIONS.md logs architectural choices — add entries before implementing changes
- ROADMAP.md captures future directions — items flow to DECISIONS.md when evaluated
- CHANGELOG.md tracks evolution narratively — update after significant work

## Agent Boundaries

### Do
- Read this file at session start
- Follow template variable conventions exactly
- Log decisions in DECISIONS.md before implementing significant changes
- Update CHANGELOG.md after making changes
- Test templates by mentally interpolating variables to check output quality
- Keep SKILL.md self-contained and executable

### Don't
- Add runtime dependencies — this plugin has zero deps by design
- Change template variable names without updating SKILL.md's interpolation table
- Overwrite user files — the /init skill must always present and get approval first
- Merge human-facing and agent-facing documentation

## Design Principles

1. **Progressive disclosure** — The scaffold starts simple (5 core files + adaptive extras). Future versions add layers for specialized project types. Don't front-load complexity.


2. **Dual-audience documentation** — README for humans, CLAUDE.md for agents. This principle applies both to the plugin itself and to what it generates.

3. **Adaptive detection** — Infer from environment first, ask only what can't be determined. Smart defaults beat questionnaires.

4. **Source-grounded defaults** — Every template design choice traces to a documented source. See README.md Design Sources section.

5. **Convention over configuration** — Prefer consistent patterns. When adding a new template or modifying an existing one, follow established patterns.

6. **Layered generation** — Core files are always generated. Tool-specific and team-specific files adapt to the user's setup.

7. **Eat your own cooking** — This plugin repo uses its own scaffold pattern. Changes to templates should be reflected here, and vice versa.
